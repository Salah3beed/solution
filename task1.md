4. No it's not excutable.
the solution would be to change the permissions of the file to make it excutable 
by typing `chmod +x test`

5. because typing sh excutes the script in a new shell process like typing the command itself in the terminal 

7. using the Shenbag ! it's writting in the beginning of the file ` #/bin/sh `  . Same goes if you want it to run with bash you type ` #/bin/bash `
8. >  `touch test.py`  `chmod +x test.py` `./test.py` 
9. > is used to overwrite a file while >> is used to append a file 

 Examples `man vim > vimGuide` `man ranger >> vimGuide`
 Output of the first is just the guide of vim while the second is the guide of vim and ranger
10. in the bash.rc file add the following line `alias ll='ls -alh' `
